- 👋 Hi, I’m @ErinMoran
- 👀 I’m interested in non-coding RNA and its roles in epigenomics. I'm currently very into R-loops and how they function to guide mitosis.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of R-loop or non-coding RNA projects! the more random and bizarre the better. I'm also interested in working on CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag projects.
